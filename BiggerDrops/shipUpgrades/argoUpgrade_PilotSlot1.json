    "Details": "The first Drop Pod launcher is back online, Boss. Getting a second one running is less about fabrication and more about logistics. The control systems use a number of rare components that we just can't make here. We'll have to source them from a specialized supplier. It won't be cheap, but securing a batch will let us refit the second bay and give us a stockpile for the rest of the project.",
