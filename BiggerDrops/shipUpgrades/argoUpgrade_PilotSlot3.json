    "Details": "Alright, Boss, all the individual launchers are ready, but dropping a full lance at once is tricky. The ship's master launch controller—the system that makes sure all the pods release without interfering or colliding with each other—is still offline. We need to get it installed and calibrated to synchronize the whole system. Once that's done, the Leopard will be fully certified for safe, lance-scale hot drops.",
