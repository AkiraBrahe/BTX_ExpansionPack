    "Details": "Fixing the hardware is one thing, Boss, but the Leopard's original targeting computer is fried. Right now, we're dropping 'dumb'—the pod gets the BattleMechto the ground safely, but the landing zone is a guess at best. We'll need to install a modern guidance system to give our hot drops some much-needed precision. That'll let us bring the third launcher online and start dropping our 'Mechs exactly where you want them.",
