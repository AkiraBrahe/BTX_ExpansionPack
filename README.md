# BTX Expansion Pack

A BattleTech Extended mod that aims to add tons of new content, including new 'Mechs, vehicles, and weapons, as well as extend the timeline into the 3060s.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The latest 1.0 release focuses on adding playable vehicles and related features to BattleTech Extended Tactics. Moving forward, you can expect more frequent updates bringing back the 100+ new 'Mechs and extending the timeline to the FedCom Civil War.
