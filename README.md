# BTX Expansion Pack

A BattleTech Extended mod that adds tons of new content, including new 'Mechs, vehicles, and weapons, as well as expanding the timeline into the 3060s. Requires CAC-C.

## Installation

**âš  This mod is only partially updated for BEX 2.0. It adds new features based on the Playable Tanks mod, such as more diverse vehicle rosters and, soon, vehicle factories.**

1. Install the latest versions of [BattleTech Extanded](https://discourse.modsinexile.com/t/battletech-extended-tactics/1859) and [CAC-C](https://github.com/mcb5637/BTX_CAC_Compatibility/releases/latest).
2. Remove the ".modtek" folder if present to force Modtek to rebuild the cache.
3. When updating the mod, remove the "BTX_ExpansionPack" and "BTX_PlayableVehicles" mod folders.
4. Unpack the mod folders from the "BTX_ExpansionPack" archive into your game folder, overwriting when prompted.

## Credits

This mod is bundled with a modified version of Playable Tanks by [LordRuthermore](https://github.com/lordruthermore).

Special thanks to [mcb](https://github.com/mcb5637) for enabling the display of the full vehicle names in battle, and **Hrothgar Heavenlight** for playtesting the mod extensively, suggesting exciting 'Mechs to add, and writing Yang's comments on them.

## Features

The mod is currently focused on improving the vehicle aspects of BattleTech Extended. This initial release for BEX 2.0 includes:
- Playable vehicles with over 300 new variants, including VTOLs,
- Improved and more varied vehicle rosters for all factions,
- And various QoL features from previous versions, as well as new ones.

Future updates will bring back the 100+ new 'Mechs and extend the timeline to the FedCom Civil War, among other things.
