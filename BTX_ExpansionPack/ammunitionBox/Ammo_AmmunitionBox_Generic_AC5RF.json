    "Details": "Ammo Bins contain the rounds needed for projectile-based weaponry, with at least one bin required per weapon type. Ammo Bins will explode and destroy their installed location when they receive a Critical Hit.\n\nRounds designed specifically for rapid-fire autocannons to withstand the weapon's high rate of fire. They're ideal for saturating targets and disrupting fast-moving units.\n\nRapid-Fire AC/5 rounds deal the same amount of damage per ton as a standard AC/5 round, but each ammo bin contains 160 rounds and may feed multiple weapons.",
