Ammo Bins will explode and destroy their installed location when they receive a Critical Hit.\n\nRapid-fire rounds are designed specifically for rapid-fire autocannons to withstand the weapon's high rate of fire. They're ideal for saturating targets and disrupting fast-moving or lightly armored units.\n\nRapid-Fire AC/2 Ammo Bins each contain 25 rounds and may feed multiple weapons.",
