Ammo Bins will explode and destroy their installed location when they receive a Critical Hit.\n\nArmor-piercing rounds rely on improved anti-armor warheads to penetrate armor and damage internal systems, at the expense of being heavier and reducing the weapon's accuracy.\n\nArmor-piercing AC/5 Ammo Bins each contain 10 rounds and may feed multiple weapons.",
