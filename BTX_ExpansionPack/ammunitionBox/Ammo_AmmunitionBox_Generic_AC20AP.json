Ammo Bins will explode and destroy their installed location when they receive a Critical Hit.\n\nArmor-piercing AC/20 Ammo Bins each contain 2 rounds and may feed multiple weapons.\n\nArmor-piercing rounds rely on improved anti-armor warheads to punch through armor and damage internal systems, at the expense of being heavier and reducing the weapon accuracy.",
