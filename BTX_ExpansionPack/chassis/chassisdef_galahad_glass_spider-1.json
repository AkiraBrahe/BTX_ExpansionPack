The long-range, powerful guns devastate most opponents quickly and, like the Rifleman's weapons, can rotate completely to cover the rear arc. Five tons of ammunition are stored in cross-linked bins, keeping the coil guns well supplied with forty rounds of ammo. The BattleMech is only protected by ten and a half tons of ferro-fibrous armor, far less than another 'Mech of comparable weight, but given its mission profile, the Glass Spider is best suited to operate outside of direct combat anyway.",
