    "Details": "Assigned to Gordon Zed of the Zalman Bloodname, even downgraded with primitive Succession Wars-era technology, his Behemoth was a powerful 'Mech that caused mass panic and confusion whenever it took to the field with Wolf's Dragoons Alpha Regiment during the Third Succession War. Zed's Behemoth swapped the Large Pulse Lasers for PPCs, the Small Pulse Laser for a standard model, and the twin Gauss Rifles for Autocannon/10s with four tons of reloads. The extra weight for this loadout and the heat sinks to make it viable were made possible by a reduction to a 200-rated standard engine, greatly reducing its ground speed. Like many Dragoons, Zed and his Behemoth would fall during the brutal Battle of Misery, and though the Draconis Combine might have salvaged the 'Mech, they were never able to repair or reproduce it.",
