  "Description": {
    "Details": "The KGC-0000 is a downgraded version of the KGC-000, sacrificing very little in this refit since it used very little lostech in the first place. The ferro-fibrous armor was replaced with standard armor, and the CASE equipment was removed. This freed up weight to add another ton of armor, bringing the armor protection almost in line with that of the KGC-000."
