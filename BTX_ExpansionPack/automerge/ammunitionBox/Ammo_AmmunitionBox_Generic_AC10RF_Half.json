Ammo Bins will explode and destroy their installed location when they receive a Critical Hit.\n\nRounds designed specifically for rapid-fire autocannons to withstand the weapon's high rate of fire. They're ideal for saturating targets and disrupting fast-moving units.\n\nRapid-Fire AC/10 half-capacity bins each contain 30 rounds and may feed multiple weapons.",
