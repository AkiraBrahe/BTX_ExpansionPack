It became the fastest ground vehicle to see service in the SLDF, and its speed made it ideal for reconnaissance and intelligence gathering.\n\nNot designed for combat, the Gabriel carries a single turret-mounted Medium Laser for self-defense. The turret also has an automatic target-acquisition system similar to fighters, which allows pilots to precisely aim at weak points and fire.",
