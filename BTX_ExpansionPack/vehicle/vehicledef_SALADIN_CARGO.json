Unlike its brothers, the Saladin has no turret and only carries a single short-range weapon. Despite this, it became quite popular throughout the Inner Sphere.\n\nDuring the Clan Invasion, captured Saladins were repurposed by the Clans as armored transport vehicles. The autocannons were removed and replaced with a large cargo bay and additional armor, allowing the Clans to safely transport troops, parts, and ammunition to the front lines.",
