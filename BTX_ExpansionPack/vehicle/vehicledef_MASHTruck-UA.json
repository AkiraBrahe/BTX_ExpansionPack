Trucks (Mobile Army Surgical Hospital) are mobile medical units equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment and surgical facilities. They are often deployed near the front lines, so that they can provide immediate care to injured soldiers.\n\nMany doctors feel that arming a M.A.S.H. Truck violates their Hippocratic Oath, and have the weapons removed. These variants generally mount additional armor, or in this case, additional cargo space for infantry.",
