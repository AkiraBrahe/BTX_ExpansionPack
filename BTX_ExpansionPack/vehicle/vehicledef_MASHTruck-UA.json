They are often deployed near the front lines, so that they can provide immediate care to injured soldiers.\n\nMany doctors feel that arming a MASH Truck violates their Hippocratic Oath, and have the weapons removed. These variants generally mount additional armor, or in this case, additional cargo space for infantry.",
