However, their numbers dwindled during the Succession Wars, as their remaining functional equipment was removed and installed in smaller command vans.\n\nThe loss of technology during the Succession Wars led to many mobile headquarters giving up their fusion engines in exchange for internal combustion engines. This variant also has to carry a power amplifier and generators to allow its Medium Laser and two tons of communications equipment to function.",
