Although it cannot match the firepower of super-heavy vehicles like the Demolisher or Behemoth, the Manticore remained popular even during the Succession Wars era, despite its use of an expensive and rare fusion engine.\n\nWith the rediscovery of Star League lostech, Defiance Industries developed an upgraded version of the Manticore tank that focuses on improving its weapon array while retaining as much of the original design as possible to ensure easy field upgrades. The PPC was replaced with a Large Pulse Laser, sacrificing range for accuracy. The removal of the Medium Laser and associated heat sinks made room for a Streak SRM-2 rack and Artemis IV FCS to be added to the original SRM and LRM racks. To increase survivability, Defiance upgraded the Manticore's armor to ferro-fibrous.",
