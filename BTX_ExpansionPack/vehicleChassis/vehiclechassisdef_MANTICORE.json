Although the Manticore can handle a variety of combat roles, and is heavily armored for a vehicle of its weight, it is not equipped to deal with the raw firepower of super-heavy vehicles such as the Demolisher or the Behemoth. Despite this, the popularity of the Manticore has remained high, even during the Succession Wars era with its use of an expensive and rare fusion engine.\n\nThe tank's main weapon is a Particle Projector Cannon, backed up by SRM-6 rack mounted just behind it.The SRM is mounted on vertical and horizontal swivel mounts, giving it a full 120-degree arc of fire independent of the turret. Both weapons are supported in their respective range brackets by an LRM-10 and Medium Laser.",
