    "Details": "Endo Steel was designed especially for use in BattleMech skeletons. Using zero-G manufacturing techniques that uniformly mix high-density steel with lower-density titanium and aluminum, the process produces a metal twice as strong per unit of weight as standard skeleton materials thus halving the weight of the chassis, but at an increase in overall bulk.  Laser Reflective Armor is a type of specialized armor that is effective against all types of energy weapons. It dissipates energy attacks much more efficiently than other armor types, reducing the amount of damage taken by the 'Mech mounting it.",
